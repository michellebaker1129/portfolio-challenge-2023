# Portfolio Challenge


## I'm unemployed!

Thank goodness I am enrolled in the UC Berkeley coding boot camp, which will help me land the perfect job. 

In class I learned to build a portfolio. I will continue to update this page as I learn new things, but already I have so many mad skills to show off. 

- When I present my portfolio to the employer of my dreams, they will find my name, a recent picture of me, and links to setions about me, my work, and how to contact me. 
- When my future employer clicks on the links in the navigation, th UI will scroll to the corresponding information. 
- When a recruiting team clicks on the link to the "my work" section, the UI will scroll to titles images of my amazing applications. 
- My most important project is placed first and appears larger than the other projects I am showing off.
- If the hiring team wants to see my applications for themselves, all they need to do is click the on images. 
- Even if the hiring manager is looking at my portfolio on their phone they will see a responsive presentation that adapts to their viewport.
